Upload Music Central player Idea

- one player creates a room...
    This is the person who plays the audio...
- the rest of the people may join the created room and upload files or something
- These files are then added to a queue of files awaiting their turn
- only the person incharge can delete a song from the queue...

We can greatly expand the scope of this app later if we decide to support youtube
    or something similar to that
We can add a chat functionality, making it a discord clone. add the ability to kick someone.
add a dice roll or something, I don't know. whatever.
